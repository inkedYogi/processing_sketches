[done] Summon units made from cards into territories
Show the cards of the Units in the Territory when it is selected
Select a Unit in a Territory based on which Card you click (still show ability text if card moused over)
Make a menu system: include music controls (on/off, volume)

Create room for artistic boarder

explore multi-computer programs
implement other players into game




create a sub program:
a 'tournament' among pictures in a file to determine the 'winner'
pictures are presented in two panes, and the right/left arrow keys determine the winner of bouts (this is intended to happen quickly)
images are presented in a pseudo-random order in which all images face each other every round, and a distinct winner is chosen every round
the winners and loosers of each round are pooled together with like kind, and face each other in the next round
in this fashion it should be possible to determine: the most extreme winner, the most extreme looser, strong winners, and weak loosers.

modifications:
instead of two panes, three or more images are presented at once to determine a winner (alliances? 2v1?)
images are presented sequentially each round
	in ascending order
	in descending order
	spiral out
	spiral in
Win, Loose, or Draw is chosen each round
define an 'arena' where the fights take place, and administer different conditions that affect the battle space (weather effects, magic, etc)
